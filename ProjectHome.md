## tgy9x - Original firmware of the Turnigy 9XR transmitter ##

HobbyKing do not provide change information for their Turnigy 9XR firmware. Neither do they provide information about the origin of the code. The aim of this project is to track all changes made over time and provide tools for examining the code. The administrator does not have the intention to verify that the source tree can be built.
The purpose is to provide code tracking.

First a clarification. The preloaded software in the Turnigy 9XR is er9x.
To be more specific; It is er9x from april 2012 with a few modifications made by HobbyKing.

HobbyKing forked off from er9x 762. After making the alterations they published the firmware and the code as a rar file called tgy-9xrv1-1. The modifications made to er9x are few and mostly cosmetic. Upgrading to a newer version of 9x might well be a good idea. Another good alternative is to upgrade to open9x.
